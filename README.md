# leaflet-challenge
This challenge required using USGS GeoJSON feed page and choosing a dataset to creat a visualization. I used Leaflet to create a map that plots all of the earthquakes. The size of the dots indicate magnitude and the color represents the depth. In addition, there are markers that users can click to show a popup with additional information. There is also a legend to show the meaning of the depth colors. 

My Bootcamp tutor helped me by further explaining previous class assignments. I also utilized ChatGPT to complete this challenge.
